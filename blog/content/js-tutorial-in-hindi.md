## 1. What is Javascript?

Javascript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for web development. It allows developers to create interactive and dynamic content on websites, enhancing user experience. Originally developed by Netscape as a client-side scripting language, Javascript has evolved to become a full-fledged programming language used on both the client and server sides.

## 2. Setting Up Your Environment

Before we dive into coding, it's important to set up your development environment. You will need a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and a web browser such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox to test your code.

### Steps to Set Up:

1. Download and install Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) from [here](https://nodejs.org/) to run Javascript outside the browser.
3. Open your browser's developer tools to test and debug your Javascript code.

## 3. Basic Syntax and Variables

In this section, we will learn about the basic syntax of Javascript and how to declare variables. Javascript uses `var`, `let`, and `const` for variable declarations.

### Example:

```javascript showLineNumbers
let name = "Qadees";
const pi = 3.14;
var age = 25;
